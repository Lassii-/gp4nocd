# gp4nocd
The commonly available prepatched version of Grand Prix 4 has an annoying problem of nagging for a CD despite being cracked if you don't have an optical drive in your PC. This tool modifies that version's GP4.exe to remove the said check so the game can be played without using the virtual drive-trick described elsewhere where you can find the game.

The tool accomplishes this by changing two code jumps to NOPs thus bypassing the check. It's functionality has been tested to the degree that the game launches without any tridcks but no long testing has been done.
